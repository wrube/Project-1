#Earthquake Magnitude &Depth

#Most of earthquakes from 2010 to 2023 are between 5 and 6 magnitude
Most frequent occurrence of earthquakes between 2010 and 2023 are in a depth of below 20 km.â€‹ Earthquakes with the depth of 20 and 40 km and 40 and 60 km occurred less.
Both of the images skewed to the left of the graphs.

 #There is no significant relationship between earthquake magnitude and depth since the correlation coefficient is -0.06.

 Ranking magnitudes by top 20 countries are displayed.Japan ranked first in the earthquake magnitude and a strong earthquake in 2011 resulted in a tsunami and damage a nuclear plant in Fukushima. Chile and Argentina ranked 2nd and 3rd int the magnitude of earthquake. US and Peru are also in top 5 rankings of earthquake magnitude. They are close to the ring of fire on the Pacific rim.

 The findings above are also supprted by the maps of most maximum magnitude earthquakes. Top countries are usually on the rim of different plates where earth movements are active.
